# 2048 game
This is a game I've developed using C programming language. The game consists of blocks where you have to connect each block that has the the same value, eventually reaching a maximum of 2048.
A key component of this game was to use a random number generator to output new numbers either 2, or 4 and to calculate the placement of newly generated blocks. I used the GPIO Timer which is built in to the Tiva C series processor. I've also utilized the UART to display my output.
